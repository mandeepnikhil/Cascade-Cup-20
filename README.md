# Cascade-Cup-20
A data science competition organised by Consulting & Anlaytics club IIT Guwahati seeing more than 2000+ participants and 2 round of data science hackathons, Our team landed up with Rank 32. 



# Problem Overview

 # Round 1:
Understanding the customers’ intentions can help to improve the journey, e.g., by taking shortcuts or giving recommendations to improve the overall experience is very important. With the extent of development in the field of machine learning research, personalization of services has become very common. Typically, a user’s intention on a Web site can be understood by looking at their past interactions. In concrete terms, this means that a user leaves a sequence of events about the history of his page views and interactions. An event can be that a user makes a search query, calls up an article page or receives an e-mail. This data forms the basis for working with the following techniques. Therefore, the first step is to collect or extract this data. This step has been done by Trell.

In this world of big data, Trell wants you to use the data to predict the age group of their users based on their activity on social media activities.  This will help them to divide their huge userbase and cater differently to each of them. Given this huge dataset, predict the age group of the users, the evaluation metric for the competition is the Weighted F1 score.

The Machine learning model you develop will help Trell provide better experience to their users by giving them a better user age specific content which people might find more relatable

 # Round 2: 
Absenteeism is a habitual pattern of absence from a duty or obligation without good reason. Generally,
absenteeism is unplanned absences. If a workplace exhibits high degree of absenteeism there is a
problem. It has been viewed as an indicator of poor individual performance, as well as a breach of an
implicit contract between employee and employer.
This is a 740 x 22 tabular dataset, what each column represents is given in the data dictionary. Your task is
to prepare an extensive report by preforming analysis on the dataset. Provide as many meaningful
inferences and correlations using graphs as you can. 

Data Set Name:
Analysis of absenteeism in a company
Abstract:
The database was created with records of absenteeism at work from July 2007 to July 2010 at a courier
company in Brazil.
Attribute Information:
1. Individual identification (ID)
2. Reason for absence (ICD).
Absences attested by the International Code of Diseases (ICD) stratified into 21 categories as follows:
1 Certain infectious and parasitic diseases
2 Neoplasms
3 Diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs and certain disorders involving the immune
mechanism
4 Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases
5 Mental and behavioral disorders
6 Diseases of the nervous system
7 Diseases of the eye and adnexa
8 Diseases of the ear and mastoid process
9 Diseases of the circulatory system
10 Diseases of the respiratory system
11 Diseases of the digestive system
12 Diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue
13 Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue
14 Diseases of the genitourinary system
15 Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium
16 Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period
17 Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities
18 Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified
19 Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes
20 External causes of morbidity and mortality
21 Factors influencing health status and contact with health services.
And 7 categories without (ICD), patient follow-up (22), medical consultation (23), blood donation (24),
laboratory examination (25), unjustified absence (26), physiotherapy (27), dental consultation (28).
